We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## 7. User Rights

As we do not collect any personal data, there is no user data to access, modify, or delete. Users can control the extension's functionality through the popup interface and can disable or remove the extension at any time through their browser's extension management interface.
